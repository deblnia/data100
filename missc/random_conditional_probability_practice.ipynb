    "\n",
    "In order to be ready for real-world applications of probability, it is important to understand what happens when probabilities are not independent. Very often, the probability of a certain event depends on other events happening! Let's see how this all works in this lab.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Differentiate between independent and dependent events\n",
    "* Use the multiplication rule to find the probability of the intersection of two events"
