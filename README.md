# data100

The order of priority should be this:

1. Homeworks
2. Exams
3. Labs
4. Discussions / Lectures

This ordering preferences actually coding over passive learning. I assume I'll use handouts / reference materials as needed.

Link to the class site I'm using (from Summer 2021) [here](https://ds100.org/su21/). The public-facing Github repo (with all the materials) is [here](https://github.com/DS-100/su21), and the textbook is [here](https://github.com/DS-100/textbook).

[12/1] Maybe actually this course repo: https://github.com/DS-100/su24-materials

[11/2] Found a more recent site: https://ds100.org/sp24/ (Github: https://github.com/DS-100/sp24-student/blob/main/hw/hw01/hw01.ipynb)

Some pandas puzzles might also be good with this?
