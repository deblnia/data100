# data100

The order of priority should be this:

1. Homeworks
2. Labs
3. Discussions / Lectures

This ordering preferences actually coding over passive learning. I assume I'll use handouts / reference materials as needed.

Link to the class site I'm using (from Summer 2021) [here](https://ds100.org/su21/). The public-facing Github repo (with all the materials) is [here](https://github.com/DS-100/su21), and the textbook is [here](https://github.com/DS-100/textbook).
