The order of priority should be this:

1. Homeworks
2. Labs
3. Discussions / Lectures

This ordering preferences actually coding over passive learning. I assume I'll use handouts / reference materials as needed.

Link to the class site I'm using (from Summer 2021) [here](https://ds100.org/su21/). The public-facing Github repo (with all the materials) is [here](https://github.com/DS-100/su21), and the textbook is [here](https://github.com/DS-100/textbook).
[11/2] Found a more recent site: https://ds100.org/sp24/
[10/12] Edit: I don't think the course site works anymore. Some third-party repos I can work through: 
- https://github.com/MartinLwx/Data100-Fall-2021-UCB?tab=readme-ov-file
- https://github.com/anniedang123/data100

Some pandas puzzles might also be good with this?
